**AltAPI CLI**

AltAPI CLI is a command-line tool for interacting with the AltLinux API. It allows you to retrieve information about packages in various branches of the AltLinux project and compare them.
Usage

**Compile and run the application by entering the following command in your terminal:**

    java -jar altProject.jar

The application will prompt you to choose two packages from the list provided in the console. To select packages, enter their numbers separated by commas.

After selecting the packages, the application will make a request to the AltLinux API, retrieve information about the packages, and compare their versions. The result will be displayed in JSON format.

**Dependencies**

The application requires the following dependencies to function:

    Jakarta JSON API: Used for processing JSON data from AltLinux API responses.
